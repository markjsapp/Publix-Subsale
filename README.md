For the full gif click [here](https://gfycat.com/dependablewarpedallosaurus). By using Python, I wanted to answer the age old question of whether or not chicken tender subs are on sale at Publix. This is one of my first python programs that utilizes a GUI. Web scraping is done by using Selenium to check if the subs are currently on sale. Keep in mind weekly ads start on Thursday and end on Wednesday!
